# TriviaGame
With my trivia game, I have three files. style.css, app.js, and index.html. I also have a picture called minasTirith.jpg in my image folder under assets.

index.html:

You will see in my html that I only have text for my h1 and h3 element. all the other elements you see will have data loaded into it through javscript file app.js. I have included some bootstrap and some id tags, classes to link css and javascript, and ids to link my javascript.


style.css:

You will see that I have added some style for some classes and also for the radio buttons.

I have also included a media query to make my background picture look better when doing the trivia game on a mobile phone. 


app.js:

I first created a wordbank by doing an array with objects in it. That way I can use the index to make my for loops and generate my triva into the webpage.
When looking at the comments in the app.js file, you will see each of the functionalities and what is going on.
